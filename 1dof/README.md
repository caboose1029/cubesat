# One Degree of Freedom Prototype

## Project Goals
Our primary goal is to balance a system in one degree of freedom prior to moving to a more complex six degree of freedom system. This serves as a proof of concept, as well as an opportunity to familiarize ourselves with concepts critical to the completion of our final CubeSat project. Primarily, our focus will be to:

1. Develop a platform for testing control algorithms along a single axis.
2. Familiarize ourselves with the hardware and software we will use in the final CubeSat project.
3. Enhance our understanding of PID control systems, electronics, and CAD modeling.
